My apps are currently in service at the customer's quarters. For a while I have been also working on the development of intelligent devices, such as ZBM OSSA torque wrench. In the meantime, I obtained a Master's degree in Automation and Robotics AGH University. I am also planning to start PhD studies this year.",
  "home.milosz_long_text": "Through my last three years in professional software development I have learned that beautiful code that does not provide value for the user is worthless, but also using shortcuts at the beginning often causes a lot of problems later on. I believe that keeping a balance between software quality and delivering business values is the hardest and most important task of a software developer. I focus mainly on web application, backend as well as frontend, but I am always open to new challenges and supporting the team in different areas.",

I used to work as a backend developer, but when it comes to recent years, I am more into mobile/web development.",
